# Theo-AI Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices behind Theo-AI, our AI-driven Telegram helper designed to streamline enterprise business development and research. We’ve built Theo-AI to be stateless and serverless, ensuring that each API call carries its own context and that Theo-AI remains efficient and scalable. Below is a detailed explanation of the technologies we’ve selected and how they contribute to the platform’s overall functionality.

## Frontend Technologies

Although Theo-AI is primarily accessed through messaging apps like Telegram rather than a traditional web or mobile interface, the system includes an application layer that handles user interactions within group chats. This component is critical to the user experience and includes the following:

- **Telegram Bot Interface**
  - Acts as the primary user interface within Telegram group chats.
  - Handles reading chat messages and sending responses, making interactions seamless and natural.
  - Maintains conversation context to ensure that responses from Theo-AI are accurate and relevant.

The Telegram bot is designed to present a professional, courteous, and direct tone, aligning with the needs of business development professionals and ensuring that every interaction is meaningful and focused.

## Backend Technologies

The backbone of Theo-AI is composed of several core backend technologies that enable its advanced research and response functionalities:

- **agno Framework**
  - Serves as the foundation for the AI agent, enabling multi-agent functionalities and easy integration with external tools.
  - Provides a structured approach for connecting different services and research tools critical to Theo-AI's operation.

- **Serverless Architecture**
  - Supports the stateless design of Theo-AI, allowing each API call to be independent and self-contained.
  - Enhances scalability since the system does not rely on long-running server processes.

- **OpenAI Compatible API**
  - Ensures that Theo-AI can use various underlying AI models for processing and reasoning.
  - Provides flexibility for future upgrades; initially, Theo-AI may start with a single model with the potential to support multiple models later.

- **Web Scraping & Web Search Tools**
  - Allow Theo-AI to gather detailed information from external websites, including company pages, Crunchbase, and LinkedIn.
  - Enable real-time research that supports the business development activities triggered by Telegram interactions.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

To maintain a high level of reliability, scalability, and ease of deployment, we have made strategic infrastructure choices:

- **Cloud-Based Serverless Hosting**
  - Supports the serverless design by hosting our API endpoints in a cloud environment that scales automatically with demand.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**
  - Automated testing and deployment pipelines ensure code quality and facilitate rapid updates.
  - This setup minimizes downtime and accelerates the delivery of new features and improvements.

- **Version Control Systems (e.g., Git)**
  - Used for source code management to coordinate team contributions and maintain a robust development history.

These infrastructure components work together to provide a stable, efficient, and easily deployable solution for Theo-AI, ensuring that it can handle fluctuating demand and continuous improvements.

## Third-Party Integrations

Theo-AI leverages several external services to extend its functionality, making it a powerful tool for business development:

- **Google Calendar Integration**
  - Enables scheduling of calls and meetings directly through the bot.
  - Plans for future integrations with tools such as cal.com and Calendly to offer even broader scheduling capabilities.

- **External Data Sources**
  - Integration with company websites, Crunchbase, and LinkedIn via web scraping and search tools to gather in-depth information about businesses and individuals.
  - These integrations provide rich, actionable data that supports effective research, synergy identification, and proposal planning.

- **API Authentication**
  - Provides secure access control for calls to the Theo-AI endpoint and ensures that only authorized users can access premium integrations (if provided by users).

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are key aspects of the overall design of Theo-AI:

- **API Authentication and Authorization**
  - Robust authentication measures protect the API endpoints and external integrations against unauthorized access.
  - Allows the possibility for users to supply specific API keys for extra functionality if needed.

- **Stateless Design for Enhanced Performance**
  - Theo-AI is built as a stateless agent, ensuring each call contains full context which minimizes dependency on persistent sessions.
  - This design reduces server load and simplifies scalability, allowing each request to be processed quickly and independently.

- **Efficient Data Management**
  - The responsibility for maintaining conversation context and historical data is offloaded to application layers like the Telegram bot or separate databases (SQL or vector-based storage), allowing Theo-AI to focus on processing and research.
  
## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

To sum up, our technology choices for Theo-AI are tailored to creating a robust, efficient, and user-friendly AI assistant for business development professionals. Here’s a quick recap of our tech stack:
