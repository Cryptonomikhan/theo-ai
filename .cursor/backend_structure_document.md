# Backend Structure Document

This document provides a clear overview of the backend architecture and infrastructure for Theo-AI, the Telegram Helper for Enterprise Ops. It explains every component of the backend in everyday language so that anyone, regardless of technical background, can understand how it all works together.

## 1. Backend Architecture

- **Serverless and Stateless:** The Theo-AI system is built as a serverless solution. This means no permanent servers are maintained and every API call is self-contained with its full context. This design supports rapid scaling, simpler maintenance, and reduced infrastructure overhead.
- **agno Framework & Multi-Agent System:** Built on the agno framework, the backend uses a multi-agent architecture where different agents handle tasks such as web search, web scraping, and API integrations. Each agent performs a specific function, making the entire system adaptable and modular.
- **Design Patterns:** The backend leverages best practices for modular design, ensuring that every component (research, interaction, scheduling, etc.) is isolated but integrated through clear APIs. This separation of concerns boosts performance and makes future enhancements straightforward.

## 2. Database Management

- **Tech Stack for Data Handling:**
  - • NoSQL Databases (e.g., AWS DynamoDB or Google Firestore) for flexible, scalable storage of session data, logs, and agent interactions.
  - • SQL Databases (potentially PostgreSQL) for structured data if needed, such as event scheduling details or user configuration settings.

- **Data Structure and Storage:**
  - Data related to chat contexts, agent actions, and scheduling events is stored in a way that allows rapid access and updates. 
  - A NoSQL database is ideal for quickly storing JSON-like data, which fits well with the message-based data exchanged in Telegram.
  - For transactional data (like scheduling calls), an SQL database may be used to ensure data integrity and consistency.

- **Data Management Practices:**
  - Regular backups and replication strategies are employed to ensure data durability and availability.
  - Data is accessed through secure API endpoints, following best practices in database security and maintenance.

## 3. Database Schema

### Human Readable Overview:

- **Users (if applicable):**
  - Contains user identities, authentication tokens, and settings for individuals or enterprises interacting with Theo-AI.

- **Chat Sessions:**
  - Records each incoming message in the Telegram group along with related metadata such as sender information and timestamps.
  - Stores the complete chat context required for each API call.

- **Agent Actions Log:**
  - Logs details of agent responses, research data gathered from web scraping and search, and AI decision steps.

- **Scheduling Events:**
  - Saves information about scheduled calls including date, time, linked Google Calendar event IDs, and participant details.

### Example Database Schema in SQL (PostgreSQL):

-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    AuthToken VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    CreatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Chat Sessions Table
CREATE TABLE ChatSessions (
    SessionID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ChatContext JSONB NOT NULL,
    Sender VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Agent Actions Log Table
CREATE TABLE AgentActions (
    ActionID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    SessionID INT REFERENCES ChatSessions(SessionID),
    ActionDetails JSONB NOT NULL,
    CreatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Scheduling Events Table
CREATE TABLE CalendarEvents (
    EventID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    SessionID INT REFERENCES ChatSessions(SessionID),
    GoogleCalendarEventID VARCHAR(255),
    EventTime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    CreatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

- **API Approach:**
  - The Theo-AI backend is designed as a RESTful API. Every request carries a chat context and a system prompt detailing Theo-AI's purpose and operational rules.

- **Key Endpoints:**
  - **POST /api/chat:** Receives the complete chat context (formatted as 'party: message') and returns an AI-generated response based on the embedded rules and reasoning.
  - **POST /api/schedule:** Handles scheduling requests. Data is forwarded to Google Calendar and additional mechanisms can be integrated in the future for Cal.com and Calendly.
  - **GET /api/config:** Provides configuration settings or system health indicators for the client.
  - **Authentication Endpoints:** Secure endpoints to manage API keys and tokens for ensuring that only authorized users and systems can make requests.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

- **Cloud-Based Serverless Environment:**
  - The backend will be hosted on a cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform. Using services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions ensures that we pay only for the exact compute usage and benefit from automatic scaling.

- **Benefits of Chosen Hosting Solutions:**
  - **Reliability:** Managed services ensure high durability and uptime.
  - **Scalability:** Seamless scaling during usage spikes without manual intervention.
  - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-for-use pricing minimizes idle resource costs and optimizes spending, especially important for startup budgets.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

- **Load Balancers and API Gateways:**
  - A Cloud API Gateway (such as AWS API Gateway) handles incoming requests, directing them to the correct serverless functions while managing load distribution.

- **Caching Mechanisms:**
  - A caching layer (for example, using serverless Redis) can be added if quick access to frequently used data becomes necessary.

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**
  - For delivering any static content or documentation related to the API, a CDN like AWS CloudFront can be used to enhance response times globally.

- **Integration of Components:**
  - These components work together to ensure that user requests are handled quickly, data is securely stored, and overall system performance remains robust even as usage scales.

## 7. Security Measures

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - All API endpoints require secure API tokens or other authentication methods to ensure that only legitimate users can interact with Theo-AI.
  - Future enhancements may include more robust OAuth-based methods if integrations with other business tools are added.

- **Data Encryption:**
  - Both data at rest and in transit are encrypted. TLS is used for secure communication between clients and the backend.
  - Secure credential storage and key management practices are in place to further protect sensitive information.

- **Additional Practices:**
  - Regular audits and adherence to industry best practices help ensure that the backend remains secure and compliant with any relevant regulations.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Cloud-based monitoring solutions like AWS CloudWatch or Google Cloud Monitoring are used to track system health and performance.
  - Additional logging and error tracking tools ensure quick diagnosis and resolution of any issues.

- **Maintenance Strategies:**
  - Automated updates and scripts keep the backend up-to-date with security patches and performance improvements.
  - Continuous integration and deployment pipelines ensure that new features and fixes are rolled out smoothly.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

- **Recap:**
  - The Theo-AI backend is designed as a modern, serverless, and stateless system built on the agno framework. It efficiently handles tasks from deep research to scheduling and supports future features like mult-agent collaboration and proposal generation.

- **Integration Focus:**
  - Each component—from the database management systems to the RESTful API endpoints—works in unison to provide quick, reliable service while maintaining high security and scalability.

- **Unique Aspects:**
  - The multi-agent approach not only simplifies current operations but also paves the way for future automation, making Theo-AI a cutting-edge tool in enterprise business development.
