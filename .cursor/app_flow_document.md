# Theo-AI App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

New users begin their journey with Theo-AI by discovering it as a Telegram bot that is added to a group chat. When a business development or sales professional attends conferences or seeks streamlined enterprise operations, they are introduced to Theo-AI either through direct recommendations or by accessing documentation provided on a landing page. In cases where a web portal is provided for API key management and further integrations, the user is prompted to sign up using simple methods such as email registration or connecting through social login. Once registered, users receive API credentials ensuring that each call to Theo-AI is authenticated securely. Additionally, users can sign in to an integrated dashboard if available; here they can manage their account, view integration settings, and, if necessary, recover lost passwords through a straightforward email-based recovery process. Signing out is as simple as clicking a dedicated logout option in the dashboard, ensuring that account access remains secure.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successfully signing in, users who choose to interact outside of Telegram are welcomed by a clean and intuitive dashboard interface. This main page displays key elements such as a sidebar with navigation options, a header that includes notifications and account information, and central widgets that highlight recent activity or pending integration tasks. However, the primary interaction remains within the Telegram group chat, where Theo-AI actively participates in conversations. The dashboard may also provide insights on recent API calls or a history of interactions, and it offers easy navigation links that allow the user to quickly jump to detailed settings or integration management areas. The design ensures that whether the user is in the Telegram environment or browsing through the dashboard, the pathways to access further functions remain clear and interconnected.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Within any Telegram group chat, when a message is posted, the entire conversation context is captured and automatically packaged into an API call to Theo-AI. This API call is formatted in a simple ‘party: message’ structure and includes a system prompt that reinforces Theo-AI’s purpose, guidelines, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Once the call reaches the stateless agent built with the agno framework, Theo-AI begins its research—whether that means performing a web search, scraping external websites, or integrating with data sources like LinkedIn and Crunchbase. Simultaneously, if the conversation steers towards scheduling a call or arranging a meeting, Theo-AI triggers an integration with Google Calendar so that call scheduling happens seamlessly. Throughout this process, the Telegram bot component manages the continuity of the conversation by storing and linking previous chat context. In advanced workflows, if the query involves deep research into company synergies or individual profiles, the agent collaborates with additional tools and may in the future exchange information with another agent built to assemble proposal decks. Transitions between these detailed research, scheduling modules, and direct message responses are designed to be smooth and imperceptible to the user, ensuring a cohesive experience whether interacting in simple chat or engaging advanced features.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can manage their preferences and account details through an easily accessible settings interface, available both on the web-based dashboard and via Telegram commands such as /settings or /profile. In this section, users update personal information, configure notification preferences, and set up integrations such as API keys for external data sources. If a user wants to modify calendar integrations or choose between different third-party platforms for scheduling, the settings page provides simple, guided options. Furthermore, any changes made in the settings are automatically synchronized with the current state of the Telegram bot, ensuring that subsequent interactions with Theo-AI reflect updated preferences. Once adjustments are complete, users are guided back to the main flow, whether that means returning to the chat interface or the dashboard overview, thereby maintaining continuity in the overall user experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the user journey, robust error handling mechanisms ensure that any unexpected events are managed gracefully. In situations where invalid data is entered, such as an improperly formatted API call or a missing parameter in the chat context, Theo-AI instantly responds with an understandable error message that explains the problem in plain terms. Connectivity issues are also anticipated; if the serverless backend loses contact with external data sources, the system displays a fallback page or a chatbot response instructing the user to retry the request. If a restricted feature is accessed without proper authentication or permission, the response clearly informs the user about the limitation and provides pointers for how to regain access. These error states are designed to be intuitive, preventing any break in the user flow and ensuring that the trajectory from message input to final output remains as smooth as possible.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The entire experience with Theo-AI unfolds from the moment a new user adds the bot to a Telegram group chat or accesses it through a web portal. The onboarding process is simple and secure, relying on easy registration and authentication methods. From there, the main dashboard or direct chat environment serves as the launchpad for all activities, from initiating business development research to scheduling calls through integrated calendar tools. Every message sent in a group chat is captured, contextualized, and processed by a stateless agent built on the agno framework. Detailed internal processes ensure research, scheduling, and potential future proposal generation are tied neatly into the user’s conversational flow. Robust settings and account management pages enable personalized configurations, while strong error handling strategies keep the journey uninterrupted. In essence, Theo-AI offers an end-to-end solution that efficiently bridges AI-powered research and actionable business development, ensuring that opportunities are never missed and every exchange is both meaningful and productive.
